<!-- <p class="text">Welcome to the HTML-Energy! Conference created <br>to deliberate the potential of HTML and have fun</p>     -->

<p class="desc">Why is HTML so cool? Because anyone can use it! You don’t need to be an expert to start creating your own web space. That’s the real energy of HTML – it’s for all of us! HTML isn’t a vast language, yet you can do a lot with it. Anyone who wants to publish on the web can write HTML. The HTML Energy Freewrite event is a safe space where we can freely talk, share ideas, and always strive to help one another create their best work. Whether you're a beginner just starting out or an experienced developer, this event encourages collaboration, creativity, and learning in a supportive environment.</p>
